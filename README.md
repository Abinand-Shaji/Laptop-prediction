This machine learning model involves preprocessing steps such as: 

1. Handling Missing Values 
2. Feature Engineering 
    a.Extracting Numerical Values 
    b.Splitting Columns 
    c.Creating New features 
    d.Calculating PPI(Pixel Per Inches) 
3.Encoding Categorical Features 
4.Feature Selection 

Other than preprocessing this model involves steps like: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
2. Model Selection and Pipeline 
3. Model Evaluation 
4. Hyperparameter Tuning 
5. Model Persistence
